<summary><strong>📁 Route Groups in Next.js</strong></summary>

## ✅ What are Route Groups?

Route Groups in Next.js help **organize your routes and files logically** without affecting the actual **URL structure** of your app. This feature is available in the App Router (from Next.js 13+).

## 🧠 Why Use Route Groups?

When building features like authentication (`register`, `login`, `forgot-password`), it's a good idea to group them under a logical folder like `auth`. But if you do this directly, it affects the URL like so:

```txt
/auth/register
/auth/login
/auth/forgot-password
```
However, if you want the URLs to be clean like this:

```txt
/register
/login
/forgot-password
```
...but still want to organize files under auth, you can use Route Groups.

```bash
app/
├── (auth)/
│   ├── register/
│   │   └── page.tsx
│   ├── login/
│   │   └── page.tsx
│   └── forgot-password/
│       └── page.tsx

```
✅ Note: Wrapping the folder name with parentheses (auth) tells Next.js to use it only for organization and not include it in the route path.
